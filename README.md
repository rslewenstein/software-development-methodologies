### TDD (Test Driven Development) - [Done]

#### Rules:
1 - Create a test that signifies a business rule.
2 - Run the test (obviusly it will fail).
3 - Write your code until the test passes.
4 - Refactor your developed code.
5 - Run the test again.

To execute the test, before to create the projects and implments the classes:
Execute the commands line:

- cd TDD
- cd Contact.Domain.Test
- dotnet build
- dotnet test
